### Path
Raised on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and now based in Eldorado Springs, I’m passionate about the intersections of Earth systems, technology, and community. Also a lover of flying things... be it airplanes, ideas, or the occasional boomerang.  

I’m especially excited about: 
- Expanding instrumentation and figuring out how to interpret the data  
- Using ships and airplanes to gather measurements from gap regions and hard-to-reach places  
- Turning messy numbers into stories the Earth is trying to tell us  

Some questions I’d love to answer: 
- How carbon dioxide and methane move and change across different regions  
- How local atmospheric quirks tie into the bigger story of global climate change  
- How to actually take the best measurement when the planet won’t sit still
