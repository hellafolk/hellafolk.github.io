## About Me
Raised on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and now based in Eldorado Springs, I’m passionate about the intersections of Earth systems, technology, and community. Also a lover of flying things... be it airplanes, ideas, or the occasional rogue frisbee.

## What Excites Me About Earth Data Science
- Expanding instrumentation and figuring out how to interpret the data  
- Using ships and airplanes to gather measurements from gap regions and hard-to-reach places  
- Turning messy numbers into stories the Earth is trying to tell us  

## Questions I’d Like to Answer
- How carbon dioxide and methane move and change across different regions  
- How local atmospheric quirks tie into the bigger story of global climate change  
- And, maybe most importantly: how to actually take the best measurement when the planet won’t sit still
