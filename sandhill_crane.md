### The Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis)

My aunt showed me the magic of the Sandhill Cranes, nesting in the flooded spring Sierra Valley in Northeast California. Slender, sleek, their red capped head pretuding between cattails and willows. A bird call like no other. We pull over on the dirt road, and watch through binoculars.

The sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis), considered the oldest extant bird species in North America, has a fossil record dating back at least 2.5 million years (Hall, 1996). Each year, most populations migrate between breeding grounds in the northern United States, Canada, Alaska, and northeastern Siberia and wintering areas in the southern United States and northern Mexico, traveling up to 5,000 kilometers along the Central and Pacific Flyways (Krapu et al., 2011).

Migration is guided by a combination of innate orientation and learned behavior. Young cranes travel with their parents, learning the route and the location of key stopover sites—wetlands, river valleys, and agricultural fields that provide forage and refuge. These sites are critical to the species’ survival; loss of habitat or changes in hydrology along the flyways can alter migration timing and success.  

This analysis of sandhill crane migration is based on occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2024). Occurrences were linked to terrestrial ecoregions and grouped by month to identify temporal and spatial patterns of movement. Very rare occurrences (three or fewer) were excluded. The data were normalized by ecoregion size and observation frequency to reduce spatial bias. The resulting dataset provides an overview of annual migration patterns and highlights the importance of major stopover regions across the western and central United States.
