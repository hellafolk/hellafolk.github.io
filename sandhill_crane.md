#### North American Aviators

My aunt showed me the magic of the Sandhill Cranes, nesting in the flooded spring Sierra Valley in Northeast California. Slender, sleek, their red capped head pretuding between cattails and willows. A bird call like no other. We pull over on the dirt road, and watch through binoculars.

The sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis), considered the oldest extant bird species in North America, has a fossil record dating back at least 2.5 million years (Hall, 1996). Each year, most populations migrate between breeding grounds in the northern United States, Canada, Alaska, and northeastern Siberia and wintering areas in the southern United States and northern Mexico, traveling up to 5,000 kilometers along the Central and Pacific Flyways (Krapu et al., 2011).

This analysis of sandhill crane migration is based on occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2024). Occurrences were linked to terrestrial ecoregions and grouped by month to identify temporal and spatial patterns of movement. Very rare occurrences (two or fewer) were excluded, and the data were normalized by ecoregion size and observation frequency to reduce spatial bias. The resulting dataset provides an overview of annual migration patterns across the western and central United States, with a specific focus on populations within North America.

Migration is guided by a mix of instinct and experience. Young cranes learn the route by flying with their parents, memorizing the landmarks like wetlands, river valleys, and open farm fields that offer food and rest. These stopover sites are vital to migration patterns, but also susceptiple to changes in climate. When they disappear or dry up, the timing and success of migration can shift in ways that ripple through the entire population.

For a long time, scientists thought of bird migration mostly in terms of geography, obvious routes shaped by topography such as mountain ranges, rivers, coastlines, using the familiar terrain to find their way. But newer studies suggest many birds can actually sense the Earth’s magnetic field through specialized light-sensitive receptors in their eyes that respond to magnetic cues. These receptors, likely based on proteins called cryptochromes, allow birds to “see” magnetic fields as faint visual patterns overlaid on their normal vision, giving them an internal compass for orientation even when landmarks or daylight are gone (Wiltschko & Wiltschko, 2019).

It would be fascinating to map the sandhill crane’s journey with that in mind, both tracing their path across North America and layering it over the magnetic deviation lines that weave across the continent. Even tracking a few individual cranes could reveal how their routes follow or cross these invisible magnetic contours, offering a glimpse into how they naviagte when they migrate. The interplay between steady magnetic fields and shifting landmarks, rivers that change course, wetlands that dry up, may influence not only how cranes navigate, but how their migratory routes evolve over time.
