## The Sandhill Crane (*Antigone canadensis*)

Growing up, I watched sandhill cranes nest in the Sierra Nevada Valley with my aunt. Each spring they returned to the flooded meadows, their low, rolling calls echoing across the valley floor. The sight of them, tall, gray, deliberat, —marked the change of season as clearly as snowmelt or the first green shoots in the fields.  

The sandhill crane is among the oldest extant bird species in North America, with fossil evidence dating back more than two million years (Gerber et al., 2014). Adults are easily identified by their red forecrown, gray plumage often stained with iron-rich mud, and long black legs. Several subspecies occur across the continent, the most widespread being the Greater and Lesser Sandhill Cranes, which differ mainly in size and migration distance.  

Most North American populations migrate annually between wintering grounds in northern Mexico and the southern United States and breeding areas in the northern United States, Canada, Alaska, and northeastern Siberia. Their primary migration corridors follow the Central and Pacific Flyways. One of the largest annual gatherings occurs along the Platte River in Nebraska, where more than half a million cranes stage each March to feed and rest before continuing north.  

Migration is guided by a combination of innate orientation and learned behavior. Young cranes travel with their parents, learning the route and the location of key stopover sites—wetlands, river valleys, and agricultural fields that provide forage and refuge. These sites are critical to the species’ survival; loss of habitat or changes in hydrology along the flyways can alter migration timing and success.  

This analysis of sandhill crane migration is based on occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2024). Occurrences were linked to terrestrial ecoregions and grouped by month to identify temporal and spatial patterns of movement. Very rare occurrences (three or fewer) were excluded. The data were normalized by ecoregion size and observation frequency to reduce spatial bias. The resulting dataset provides an overview of annual migration patterns and highlights the importance of major stopover regions across the western and central United States.
