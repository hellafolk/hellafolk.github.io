### Trinidad Head Aircraft Site 

For more than 20 years, a Mooney M20M has carried glass flasks into the sky above Trinidad Head. Like temporary glass lungs, the flasks are filled with Pacific air and shipped back to NOAA’s Global Monitoring lab in Colorado. Each flight adds to a two-decade record of aircraft measurements, capturing the breath of the Earth.

**Trinidad Head (THD)**  
41.0541 °N | 124.151 °W | 107 m  
✈ First Sample: 2003-09-02  
Altitudes: 152 m – 8131 m  

For this project, I pulled the **highest sample of the day** from each Mooney flight. The idea: way up there, the air should be above the boundary layer, offering a clearer view of the **background atmosphere**. Plotting those daily “top-of-the-sky” points over time reveals the broader story written in the air above the Pacific.

The record shows two patterns at once. As Earth breathes, CO₂ rises as winter comes and falls again in summer, tracing a seasonal cycle of respiration and growth. Layered on top of that rhythm is a steady upward climb — the year-to-year increase in background CO₂.
